  <section class="About">
    <p>
      The Kenya Police originated from British colonial security forces, established officially in 1907 to protect colonial commercial interests and maintain order. It evolved from earlier structures used by the Imperial British East Africa Company (1887–1902) and the Kenya-Uganda Railway police. Following independence in 1963, the force transitioned from a colonial tool to a national service, undergoing various reforms, with the current structure established under the 2010 Constitution.
